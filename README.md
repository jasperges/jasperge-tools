### Various tools for in Blender

Several simple tools to use:

* Incremental save like Maya has (for convenience in mixed software projects).
* Copy modifier settings from the active object to the selected object(s).
* Turn off/on the modifiers in the viewport (except: 'ARMATURE', 'CURVE' and
  'SIMPLE DEFORM') for all objects.
* Turn on/off wireframes for all objects.

Todo:

* Allow a limit for the number of incremental save files.
* Maybe turn off/on modifiers and wireframes only for selected objects.
* Add more tools if I need them...
